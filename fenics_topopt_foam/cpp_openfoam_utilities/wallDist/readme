 Utility name: wallDist

  Description: Compute the wall distance for a given time.

        Input: OpenFOAM input files

      Outputs: Plots from the computation of the wall distance

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Based on:

	"Test-wallDist":
		OpenFOAM-7/applications/test/wallDist
		-> The differences are:
			1) "Test-wallDist" does not accept the user to
		           choose the time in which the wall distance is computed.
			2) "Test-wallDist" considers moving the points of the mesh
			   from computed distances
