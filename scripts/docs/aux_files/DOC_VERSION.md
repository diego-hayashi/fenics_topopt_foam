## ❇️ API documentation

This is an auto-generated documentation from [markdown files and the source code (FEniCS TopOpt Foam 3.6)](https://github.com/diego-hayashi/fenics_topopt_foam), and was generated by using [pdoc3 0.9.2](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/). It is possible that it may contain typos and/or insufficient descriptions. Since this is a Python documentation, the C++ modules from FEniCS TopOpt Foam are left outside this documentation (* but they can be viewed in the [source code](https://github.com/diego-hayashi/fenics_topopt_foam)). The main page of the documentation has reduced information of the available class methods (i.e., it only shows the basic and most commonly used set of methods), where the "full" functionality may be checked in the respective [sub-modules pages](#header-submodules).
